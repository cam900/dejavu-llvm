## DejaVu
DejaVu is an LLVM-based GML and D&D compiler, compatible with [GameMaker](http://yoyogames.com). It is currently a plugin for the [LateralGM](http://lateralgm.org) editor, capable of compiling a game's scripts and object events.

### Todo
* Finish script argument support
* Platform linker to output executables
* Write resources to the binary
* GML standard runtime functions
* Game engine (hah)
